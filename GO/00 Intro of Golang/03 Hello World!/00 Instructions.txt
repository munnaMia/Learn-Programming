First Line :    package main
                -> This is known as a “package declaration”. Every Go program start with a package declaration. We will learn leter more about it.

Secound Line :  import "fmt" 
                -> import keyword mean importing packages for our code. "fmt" mean formating input output this is a go package.

Third Line :    func main(){}
                -> This is main function. Every go program start with this function as its run first into a code. this is also a go routine we will learn leter about it.

Forth Line :    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
                -> this line just print a Hello World! output to the terminal Println is function of fmt package.
