Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to treat objects of different classes as if they are objects of a common superclass. It enables you to write code that can work with diverse types of objects in a consistent way, provided they adhere to a shared interface or method signature.

Polymorphism allows you to:

Write generic code that operates on objects without needing to know their specific types.
Create a hierarchy of classes, with derived classes inheriting from a common base class, and override methods in the derived classes to provide specialized behavior.
Achieve code reusability by defining a common interface or base class that multiple classes can implement or inherit from.
In practice, polymorphism is commonly used when you have a variety of objects that share some common behavior but also have unique behavior based on their specific type. By using polymorphism, you can write code that focuses on the shared behavior, while still allowing for customized behavior in different types of objects, leading to more modular and extensible software.



Here's how polymorphism can be achieved in JavaScript:

Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime. This allows you to create functions or methods that can work with different types of objects without specifying their types explicitly. You can rely on the actual properties and methods of the objects during runtime.

Method Overriding: In JavaScript, you can define methods with the same name in different object prototypes. If a method with the same name is found on an object, it will be executed, and it will override any methods with the same name in the object's prototype chain.
