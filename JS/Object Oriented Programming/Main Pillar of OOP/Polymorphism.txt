Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface or method to represent a range of different types of objects and their behaviors. Polymorphism promotes code reusability, flexibility, and the ability to work with diverse objects in a more generic way.
