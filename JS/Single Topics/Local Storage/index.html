    Note: It's recommended to use the Web Storage API (setItem, getItem, removeItem, key, length) to prevent the pitfalls associated with using plain objects as key-value stores.

<pre>
    The two mechanisms within Web Storage are as follows:

sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores).
localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.
