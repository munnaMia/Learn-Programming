HTTP :
======
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, 
such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be 
used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection 
to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that 
the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.




===================================================================================================================================================
	StateLess:
	==========
	A stateless protocol refers to a type of communication protocol in which each communication between a client 
	and a server is independent and unrelated to previous or future communications. In other words, the server 
	does not maintain any information or "state" about the client's previous interactions.
		
		characteristics of stateless protocols include:
		-----------------------------------------------

			No Session State:
			================= 
			The server doesn't retain any information about the client's previous requests. Each request from the client is treated 
			as a new and independent transaction.

			Independence of Requests: 
			=========================
			Each request from the client must contain all the necessary information for the server to process it correctly. The server 
			doesn't rely on past interactions to interpret or respond to a current request.

			Scalability: 
			============
			Stateless protocols can be more scalable because servers do not need to store session information for each client, allowing 
			them to handle a larger number of clients simultaneously.

	Client Server Model:
	====================
	The client-server model is a computing architecture that defines a relationship between two distinct types of entities: 
	clients and servers. This model is commonly used in networked environments, where clients and servers communicate over 
	a network to perform tasks, share resources, or access services. 
	
		Client: 
		=======
		A client is a device or application that requests services or resources from a server. It can be a computer, 
		smartphone, tablet, or any other device capable of making requests and receiving responses. Clients initiate 
		communication by sending requests to servers.

		Server: 
		=======
		A server is a dedicated computer or software application that provides services, resources, or data in response 
		to client requests. Servers wait for incoming requests, process them, and send back appropriate responses. They 
		typically have more processing power, storage, and specialized software to handle requests from multiple clients.

		
		Key characteristics of the client-server model:
		-----------------------------------------------
		
			Communication:
			============== 
			Clients and servers communicate over a network using predefined protocols. Common communication protocols 
			include HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP, etc.

			Role Distribution: 
			==================
			Clients initiate requests for services or resources, while servers fulfill these requests by providing the 
			necessary services, data, or resources.

			Resource Sharing: 
			=================
			Servers host resources such as files, databases, applications, or services that clients can access and use. 
			This sharing enables centralized management and control of resources.

			Scalability: 
			============
			The model allows for scalability as multiple clients can interact with a single server or multiple servers 
			depending on the network setup, allowing for flexible resource allocation.

			Security and Access Control: 
			============================
			Servers often implement security measures to control access to resources, ensuring that only authorized 
			clients can access specific services or data.
